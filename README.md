# Icons-display  
## Preview all icons from all SVG sprites in your project.

SVG sprites are awesome, but it’s a real struggle to find out what icons they contain.  
The inability to preview what icons your project has, leads in most cases to huge code repetition.  
This simple, yet powerful web program helps you preview all icons, from all SVG sprites in your project.  
And that’s not all! The icons are beautifully grouped by sprites, you get info of the total count, and the count of all icons in each sprite.  
Also you can dynamically resize the icons, if you need a closer look!  

# How to use:
(1) download this repo to your project's SVG directory;  
(2) in the svg tag of the sprites, add 'id' attribute, equals of the name of the sptrite;  
(3) in icons-display.html file, add all sprite's names to the "sprites" array;  
(4) if you have NodeJS installed, just double click "Show icons.cmd" file, and the preview will load in your default browser (Linux users must change "cmd" extention to "sh"). Otherwise, use any simple web server of your choice, to serve icons-display.html file.   

(Hint: create shortcut of 'Show icons.cmd' on your desktop for easy access)
